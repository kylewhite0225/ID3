# ID3
This repository contains an implementation of the ID3 Decision Tree Algorithm written in Python. Several helper functions were created for gathering entropy and information gain, choosing the best features of a dataset (based on information gain), returning a prediction from the model, etc. A 30000 row dataframe of US Census data was used for training and testing.
